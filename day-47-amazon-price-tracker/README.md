An interesting fact I observed: 

Amazon puts different restrictions on different areas for anti-web-scraping. 

www.amazon.com almost accepts all scraping. However, www.amazon.de seems more 
restrictive, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail. 




Another interesting problem is sending emails with smtplib with google. 
Google will depreciate the "enable less secure app" functionality at May 30 2022. 

So afterwards, one should either use other mail service or use google app password.
